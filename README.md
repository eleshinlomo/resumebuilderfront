This is a Resume Building project and will eventually be integrated with a custom model for auto resume generation and auto styling.


On the backend, the model is currently being trained on how to extract keywords from job adverts and rewrite a resume to match keywords and also accessing current candidate's skills to know if the job is even worth applying for.

Resumes will be re-written and styled only for roles that candidate has more than 80% chance of getting based on model score.

Further development will also empower the model to search Linkedin and indeed to see candidate previous applications and perform a graph analysis on job type, sector, job location, client, etc where their job applications have been declined the most.
